## Steps

1. Preheat the **oven** to 180¬∞C. Remove the **oven tray**.
2. In the **mixing bowl**, put the **slightly salted butter**, **cane sugar**,
   and **egg**. Mix with the **whisk** until homegenous.
3. Add the **grated coconut**, **vanilla extract**, and **backing powder**. Mix
   until homegenous.
4. Add 25% of the **wheat flour**. Mix until homegenous. Repeat until all flour
   is incorporated.
   - _This step requires elbow grease as the dough is gets quite thick._
   - _Adding the flour bit by bit makes it much easier to mix with the rest of
     the dough._
5. Add 25% of the **oat flakes**. Mix until homegenous. Repeat until all flakes
   are incorporated.
6. Add 25% of the **dark chocolate**. Mix until homogenous. Repeat until all
   the chocolate is incorporated.
   - _This step is more easily done with your hand than with the whisk._
   - _Dough will stick to your skin. Put as much as you can back into the bowl.
     Enjoy licking your fingers. Whatever remains is easily rinced off._
7. Put the **baking paper** on the oven tray.
8. Put ~5cm balls of dough on the oven tray. Put them ~10cm apart.
9. Put the tray into the oven. Bake for ~12 minutes.
10. Remove cookies from the oven tray with the **spatula**. Put them aside to
    cool for ~10 minutes.
    - _Be careful: the cookies are fragile while hot._
11. Repeat steps 8-10 until there is no more dough.
12. Enjoy! üç™
